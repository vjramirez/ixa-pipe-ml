# Specify if adaptive features are cleared in the training and/or evaluation data.
# Options are: 'yes', 'no', 'docstart'. The first two will reset the
# features every sentence whereas the 'docstart' option will look for -DOCSTART-
# marks in the data to clear the adaptive features.
# Crossvalidation only works if ClearTrainingFeatures is set to 'yes'.
# If commented out both values default to 'no'.

#### FEATURES ####
##################

# Window: left and right window range from the current token. TokenFeatures
# and TokenClassFeatures depend on the window range specified here. If
# commented out, it will default to 2:2.
Window=5:5

# bagOfWords: 
#BagOfWordsFeatures=yes
#BagOfWordsFeaturesUseOnlyAllLetterTokens=yes

# TokenFeatures: include current token (both in original and lowercase form)
# TokenFeaturesRange: indicate whether to lowercase the tokens for feature generation.
# Choose between 'lower' and 'orig'. If commented out, it defaults to 'lower'.
TokenFeatures=yes
TokenFeaturesRange=lower

# TokenClassFeatures: include token shape features (capitalization, digits,
# etc. see TokenClassFeatureGenerator class for details
# TokenClassFeaturesRange: whether to lowercase the tokens and provide wordAndClass (wac)
# joint features. To cancel out an option, just write 'no,wac', 'lower,no' or 'no,no'.
# If commented out, it defaults to 'lower,wac'.
TokenClassFeatures=yes
TokenClassFeaturesRange=lower,wac

# BrownClusterFeatures: add features using Brown clusters
# Comment it out to deactivate this feature.
# NOTE: you can add multiple clustering lexicons by chaining them with a comma.
# The brown lexicon needs to be serialized using ixa-pipe-convert SerializeResources

# ClarkClusterFeatures: add features using Clark (2003) clusters. If value is uncommented,
# specify the location of the clustering lexicon in Clark format.
# NOTE: you can add multiple clustering lexicons by chaining them with a comma.
# The Clark lexicon needs to be serialized using ixa-pipe-convert SerializeResources

# Word2VecClusterFeatures: add features using word2vec clusters. If value is
# uncommented, specify the location of the clustering lexicon in word2vec format.
# NOTE: you can add multiple clustering lexicons by chaining them with a comma.
# The Word2vec lexicon needs to be serialized using ixa-pipe-convert SerializeResources
